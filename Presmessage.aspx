        <p>Dear Samaj Members, </p>

<p>Jai Shree Krishna  </p>

<p>First, I would like to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to serve as the President of our esteemed Gujarati Samaj. I would also like to welcome and sincerely thank all the new Management Committee members who have graciously Volunteered to work towards the betterment of the Gujarati Community. I pray to god to give me enough strength and guidance, so I can do justice to the position which has been filled by so many distinguished and elite members of Gujarati Samaj of Montreal. It is my dream that the Gujarati Samaj of Montreal will be home away from home for every Gujarati family in Montreal, I know that the task is big but I vow to tackle the challenge and come out victorious with support from all of you. 
If any members have any ideas or suggestions that can better our Samaj, I would encourage them to come forward, my entire team and I will be behind you to support and make you successful. My focus over the next two years is going to be to try and increase the membership, (which is on the decline), bring the community together and encourage the youth to participate more through the events we will put together during the year.  We’ll have fun, share a few laughs together, and enjoy each other’s company. </p>

<p>Our outgoing president Mr. Sureshbhai Kuriya along with his entire team deserves an enormous thank you from all of us who have worked hard with dedication in the past 4 years for the Samaj. </p>

<p>We will start with our first event on the 18th of February to celebrate the valentine’s day, all the details will be emailed shortly. We will be planning many more events and will announce them as soon as they are finalized.  </p>

<p>On behalf of my entire team I wish you all happy holidays and a very prosperous new year.   </p>


<p>Nemish Mehta<br/>
President </p>
